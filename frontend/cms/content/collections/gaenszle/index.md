# Martin Gaenszle

The earlier part of the ethnographic documentation in this collection resulted from Martin Gaenszle’s fieldwork in Nepal (Kathmandu Valley and East Nepal) from 1984 to 1994. He was Resident Representative of the [South Asia Institute (Heidelberg University)](http://www.sai.uni-heidelberg.de/) from 1987 to 1994, and during this time he not only pursued his research on the Mewahang Rai (see “Mewahang Rai Collection”) but also observed many festivals and other events in the Kathmandu Valley. From 2000 to 2003 he did research in Benares (India) on “Ethnic Space and Locality: The Nepali Community in Benares”, as part of the joint project “Visualized Space: Constructions of Locality and Cartographic Representation in Benares”, based at the South Asia Institute at Heidelberg (grant from the “[German Research Foundation/DFG](http://www.dfg.de/)”). The collection also includes materials from more recent field trips (e.g. Sikkim).
