# The Himalaya Archive Vienna

The **HAV** is a modern multimedia archive at the [Center for InterÂ­disciplinary Research and Documentation of Inner and South Asian Cultural History (CIRDIS)](http://www.univie.ac.at/cirdis/), [University of Vienna](https://www.univie.ac.at/), and home to research documentation from South and Inner Asia with a special focus on the Himalaya.

Its over-arching archive structure houses multi-disciplinary data originating from largely third-party funded research projects as well as private collections or donations. It aims to provide a strong foundation for the successful collaboration between research partners from various disciplines united by a common interest and wish to preserve and share their data according to the policies of the open science community.

The HAV is under acvtive development. This first release is a glimpse into the thematic and geographical width and depth of the material currently being archived and a series of advanced representational features planned to be integrated later on. At the time of writing a number of further collections are already being evaluated and/or prepared for ingestion.

Further information about us, our ongoing research initiatives and related news can be found on the website of [CIRDIS](http://www.univie.ac.at/cirdis).
