The data presenting in this collection derive from the project "The Scientific Legacy of René de Nebesky-Wojkowitz" ([P 31570](https://pf.fwf.ac.at/de/wissenschaft-konkret/project-finder/44277), 10/2018-09/2022), directed by Martin Gaenszle and funded by the [Austrian Science Fund (FWF)](https://www.fwf.ac.at/) and is here reunited as a valuable contribution to the preservation and utilization of the legacy of the Austrian Tibetologist and ethnographer René Nebesky-Wojkowitz (1923-1959).

The project concentrates on Nebesky-Wojkowitz's three travels to South Asia (1950-1953, 1956-1957 and 1958-1959) and on his heterogeneous material of various ethnic cultures – consisting of monographs, articles, field notes, tape recordings, photographs and film material, Tibetan manuscripts and texts, as well as numerous ethnological and artistic artefacts. The largest part of these resources is today in the possession of the [Weltmuseum Wien](https://www.weltmuseumwien.at/). The project especially looks into the geographical, political and socio-historical context of his journeys.

Nebesky-Wojkowitz's material to be analysed from different perspectives and with the distinctive methods of each discipline involved in the project (art-history, anthropology, South Asian studies, Tibetology and religious studies) should highlight the importance of his pioneering and influential work not only on Tibetan religion but on many other aspects of Himalayan culture. By combining Nebesky-Wojkowitz's multimedia estate with all kind of data collected during project’s field trips to India (West Bengal, Sikkim) and Nepal will furthermore document the changes that have taken place in that regions over the last 70 years.
