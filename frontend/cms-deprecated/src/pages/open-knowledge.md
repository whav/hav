In accordance with the [reusability considerations of FAIR](https://www.force11.org/group/fairgroup/fairprinciples) the HAV supplies its data and metadata with clearly specified and accessible – both to humans and machines – licensing in order to ensure their availability and reusability.

The HAV's metadata is made available under Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0). The larger part of the HAV's initial collections will be made available under Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International (CC BY-SA 4.0) but more open licences such as CC BY and CC0 will be supported as well.
On the other end of the spectrum – to address copyright and complex ethical and/or moral issues – a number of non-open licenses such as CC BY-NC-SA 4.0, CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 and “all rights reserved” are available in order to accommodate these diverse needs. In addition to the above, the HAV will provide the possibility of archiving materials with a predefinable embargo period. It thus allows for the secure archiving of research data prior to its open release (e.g. while still being the object of ongoing research within a running project).
