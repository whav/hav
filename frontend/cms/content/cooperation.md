CIRDIS welcomes all research initiatives working in the extended Himalayan area, especially those wishing to preserve and share their data according to the policies of an open science community. If you want to profit from and contribute to our interdisciplinary approach and ideas and concepts on multi-modal archiving, CIRDIS is looking forward to share its expertise and infrastructure. We encourage you to [contact us](mailto:hav@univie.ac.at,office.cirdis@univie.ac.at) - we are always looking forward to collaborations strengthening the field of Himalayan studies through open and innovative ideas.

More information about us and our previous and ongoing research and documentation initiatives can be found on our [center's website](http://www.univie.ac.at/cirdis). If you are interessted in a cooperation, consider giving a look at our [Data Management Plan](http://www.univie.ac.at/cirdis/documentation/data-management-plan) and our recently published [Technical Considerations and Preparations for Anthropological Field Research Documentation](http://www.univie.ac.at/cirdis/documentation/technical-fieldresearch). Both of which can be found at the ["documentation" section](http://www.univie.ac.at/cirdis/documentation) of our website.
